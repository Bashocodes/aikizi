# SPA Routing Fix - Direct URL Access

## Problem Fixed

**Before:** Accessing URLs directly (e.g., `/explore`, `/p/{id}`) resulted in 404 errors
**After:** All routes now work with direct URL access and browser refresh

## Root Cause

Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React use client-side routing. When you access a URL directly:
1. Browser requests the URL from the server (e.g., `GET /explore`)
2. Server doesn't have a file at `/explore` → Returns 404
3. React Router never gets a chance to handle the route

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `public/_redirects` file
This file tells Cloudflare Pages (or any hosting platform) to serve `index.html` for ALL requests:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

This means:
- Request `/explore` → Server returns `index.html` with 200 status
- React Router loads in the browser
- React Router sees the URL is `/explore` and renders `ExplorePage`

### 2. Created `public/_headers` file
Optimized caching strategy:
- Static assets (JS, CSS) cached for 1 year
- `index.html` never cached (ensures routing always works)

### 3. Updated `vite.config.ts`
Explicitly set `publicDir: 'public'` to ensure files are copied during build

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/vite.config.ts` - Added `publicDir` configuration
- ✅ `/public/_redirects` - SPA redirect rule
- ✅ `/public/_headers` - Cache headers

## Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages
The `_redirects` file in your `dist` folder will be automatically detected and used.

**Deploy command:**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to Cloudflare Pages
```

### Netlify
Same `_redirects` file works for Netlify as well.

### Vercel
If you're using Vercel, create `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

## Testing

After deployment:
1. ✅ Go to `https://aikizi.xyz/explore` directly → Should load Explore page
2. ✅ Go to `https://aikizi.xyz/p/{post-id}` directly → Should load post detail
3. ✅ Refresh any page → Should stay on that page (not 404)
4. ✅ Browser back/forward buttons → Should work correctly

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
ls dist/_redirects  # Should exist
ls dist/_headers    # Should exist
```

## Status
✅ Build successful
✅ Redirect files copied to dist/
✅ Ready for deployment
