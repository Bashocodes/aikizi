# Google OAuth Hardening - Implementation Complete

## Changes Summary

All changes have been successfully implemented to ensure Google OAuth reliably produces a Supabase session and the UI only renders the signed-in state after the session is established.

---

## 1. Dedicated OAuth Callback Route

**File:** `src/pages/AuthCallbackPage.tsx` (NEW)

- Created a standalone callback component at `/auth/callback` route
- Checks URL for `code` and `state` query parameters
- Calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(window.location.href)` when present
- On success: navigates to `/explore` with clean URL (replace mode)
- On error: displays error message and redirects to home after 3 seconds
- If no code/state: immediately redirects to `/explore` (passthrough behavior)
- Renders only minimal loading spinner without Navigation or app shell
- Integrates with ThemeProvider for consistent dark mode styling

---

## 2. Updated OAuth Sign-In Flow

**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `signInWithGoogle()` to redirect to `https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback` instead of `/explore`
- Removed any manual window.location manipulation
- Added `[Auth]` prefix to all console.error logs for consistent debugging

**New redirect URL:**
```typescript
redirectTo: 'https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback'
```

---

## 3. Router Structure with Auth Gate

**File:** `src/App.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `/auth/callback` as a top-level route that bypasses the `authReady` gate
- All other routes now wait for `authReady === true` before rendering
- When `authReady === false`, shows `<BootScreen />` for all routes except callback
- Moved `<Navigation />` into individual route elements (not shared across all routes)

**Route hierarchy:**
```
/auth/callback          → AuthCallbackPage (no auth gate)
/*                      → authReady ? (all other routes) : BootScreen
  /                     → Navigation + LandingPage
  /explore              → Navigation + ProtectedRoute(ExplorePage)
  /decode               → Navigation + ProtectedRoute(DecodePage)
  etc.
```

## 4. Auth State Management

**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**Existing behavior (verified correct):**
- Single Supabase client instance created at app bootstrap ✓
- `getSession()` called once on mount before setting `authReady=true` ✓
- `onAuthStateChange` subscription active throughout app lifecycle ✓
- Session state updated on every auth event ✓
- Diagnostic logging with `[Auth]` prefix for debugging ✓

**Boot sequence:**
1. AuthContext mounts
2. Logs: `[Auth Boot] Origin: ... URL: ...`
3. Calls `getSession()`
4. Logs: `[Auth] INITIAL_SESSION: ...`
5. Sets `authReady=true`
6. Logs: `[Auth] authReady=true ...`
7. Subscribes to `onAuthStateChange`
8. All subsequent events logged: `[Auth] onAuthStateChange: ...`

---

## 5. Navigation UI State Contract

**File:** `src/components/Navigation.tsx`

**Existing behavior (verified correct):**
- When `authReady === false`: Shows loading skeleton/spinner ✓
- When `authReady === true && !user`: Shows "Sign In" button ✓
- When `authReady === true && !!user`: Shows token balance + "Sign Out" button ✓

**No changes needed** - already implements the correct three-state pattern.

---

## 6. Netlify Configuration

**File:** `netlify.toml`

**Existing behavior (verified correct):**
- 301 redirect from www.aikizi.xyz to aikizi.xyz (canonical) ✓
- SPA fallback redirect (200 status) for client-side routing ✓
- Order is correct: 301 redirects happen before SPA fallback ✓

**No changes needed** - already correctly configured.

---

## Supabase Configuration Requirements

Ensure these settings in your Supabase dashboard:

### Authentication > URL Configuration
- **Site URL:** `https://aikizi.xyz`
- **Redirect URLs (allowlist):**
  - `https://aikizi.xyz/*`
  - `https://chipper-zuccutto-0bf824.netlify.app/*` (Netlify preview)
  - `http://localhost:5173/*` (local development)

### Authentication > Providers > Google
- **Enabled:** Yes
- **Client ID:** [Your Google OAuth Client ID]
- **Client Secret:** [Your Google OAuth Client Secret]
- **Callback URL (read-only):** `https://qdknlxmksutvskhzjcca.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

---

## Google Cloud Platform OAuth Configuration

Ensure these settings in your GCP Console:

### Authorized JavaScript origins
- `https://aikizi.xyz`
- `https://chipper-zuccutto-0bf824.netlify.app`
- `http://localhost:5173`

### Authorized redirect URIs
- `https://qdknlxmksutvskhzjcca.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT put your site URL (aikizi.xyz) in redirect URIs - it belongs in JavaScript origins only!

---

## Expected OAuth Flow

### User clicks "Sign In"
1. User clicks "Sign In" button in Navigation
2. App calls `signInWithGoogle()`
3. Supabase redirects to Google OAuth consent screen

### Google redirects back
4. Google redirects to: `https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback?code=...&state=...`
5. AuthCallbackPage mounts (bypasses authReady gate)
6. Page calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(window.location.href)`
7. Supabase exchanges code for session and stores it in localStorage
8. AuthContext's `onAuthStateChange` fires with `SIGNED_IN` event
9. AuthCallbackPage navigates to `/explore` with clean URL

### User lands on /explore
10. App shows BootScreen while `authReady === false`
11. AuthContext loads session from localStorage
12. Sets `authReady=true` and `session={...}`
13. App renders Navigation with signed-in state (token balance + sign out)
14. ExplorePage renders with user data

---

## Diagnostic Logging

All auth-related logs are prefixed with `[Auth]` or `[Supabase]` for easy filtering.

**To view logs during OAuth flow:**
1. Open browser DevTools → Console
2. Filter by: `[Auth]` or `[Supabase]`

**Expected log sequence during sign-in:**
```
[Supabase] Client initialized once at app bootstrap
[Auth Boot] Origin: https://aikizi.xyz URL: https://aikizi.xyz/
[Auth] INITIAL_SESSION: no session
[Auth] authReady=true no user
[Auth Callback] URL params: { code: true, state: true }
[Auth Callback] Exchanging code for session...
[Auth Callback] Exchange successful, user.id: abc123...
[Auth] onAuthStateChange: SIGNED_IN user.id=abc123...
[Auth] INITIAL_SESSION: user.id=abc123...
[Auth] authReady=true user.id=abc123...
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **After clicking Sign In, Google returns to https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback with code/state**
- Implemented via `redirectTo: 'https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback'`

✅ **The page calls exchangeCodeForSession, then navigates to /explore**
- Implemented in AuthCallbackPage.tsx

✅ **The first paint of /explore shows the signed-in header (no 'Sign In' button)**
- Implemented via authReady gate and Navigation UI state contract

✅ **Hard-refresh on /explore keeps the session (persistSession works)**
- Already working via Supabase client config: `persistSession: true`

✅ **No duplicate Supabase client instances are created**
- Verified: single initialization log in supabase.ts

✅ **URL never flips between www and apex during or after login**
- Verified: netlify.toml has 301 redirect from www to apex

---

## Production Deployment

After deploying these changes to production:

1. **Verify environment variables in Netlify:**
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` (marked as secret)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (marked as secret)

2. **Trigger a new deployment** if environment variables were changed

3. **Clear browser cache** before testing to ensure fresh build

4. **Test the complete OAuth flow** using the checklist above

5. **Monitor Supabase logs** for any errors:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qdknlxmksutvskhzjcca/logs/explorer
   - Filter by: auth events

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Database error saving new user"
- **Cause:** Missing `handle_new_user` trigger in Supabase
- **Fix:** Run migration `004_handle_new_user_trigger.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

### Redirects to wrong domain (www vs apex)
- **Cause:** Google OAuth redirect or Supabase Site URL misconfigured
- **Fix:** Ensure all configs use `https://aikizi.xyz` (no www)

### "Invalid redirect URL"
- **Cause:** Callback URL not in Supabase allowlist
- **Fix:** Add `https://aikizi.xyz/*` to Supabase Redirect URLs

### Session not persisting after refresh
- **Cause:** Browser blocking cookies or localStorage
- **Fix:** Ensure site is served over HTTPS and no browser extensions blocking storage

### Still shows "Sign In" button after successful login
- **Cause:** AuthContext not receiving SIGNED_IN event
- **Fix:** Check browser console for `[Auth]` logs, verify Supabase client initialization

---

## Development vs Production

### Local Development (localhost:5173)
- Update `.env` file with Supabase credentials
- Google OAuth needs `http://localhost:5173` in JavaScript origins
- Supabase needs `http://localhost:5173/*` in Redirect URLs
- AuthContext should use `redirectTo: 'http://localhost:5173/auth/callback'` for local testing

**To test locally:**
```typescript
// Temporarily change in AuthContext.tsx
redirectTo: import.meta.env.DEV
  ? 'http://localhost:5173/auth/callback'
  : 'https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback'
```

### Production (aikizi.xyz)
- Environment variables set in Netlify dashboard
- Google OAuth uses `https://aikizi.xyz` in JavaScript origins
- Supabase uses `https://aikizi.xyz/*` in Redirect URLs
- AuthContext uses `redirectTo: 'https://aikizi.xyz/auth/callback'`

---

## Summary

The Google OAuth flow is now hardened with:
1. ✅ Dedicated callback route that properly exchanges code for session
2. ✅ Auth gate that prevents UI rendering before session is established
3. ✅ UI state contract that shows correct buttons based on auth state
4. ✅ Diagnostic logging for debugging the complete flow
5. ✅ Defensive routing that protects OAuth query parameters
6. ✅ Single Supabase client instance with correct configuration

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to production
2. Update Supabase and Google OAuth settings (if not already done)
3. Test the complete flow using the checklist above
4. Monitor logs for any issues

**Build Status:** ✅ Passing (no TypeScript or build errors)
